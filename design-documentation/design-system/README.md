# Easy Risk Register - Design System

## Overview

The Easy Risk Register design system establishes consistent guidelines for visual design, components, and interactions. This system ensures a cohesive user experience across all features while maintaining the application's core values of simplicity, privacy, and usability.

## Design Philosophy

Our design philosophy centers on "bold simplicity" with intuitive navigation, creating frictionless experiences that prioritize user needs over decorative elements. We focus on:

- Breathable whitespace complemented by strategic color accents for visual hierarchy
- Strategic negative space calibrated for cognitive breathing room and content prioritization
- Systematic color theory applied through subtle gradients and purposeful accent placement
- Typography hierarchy utilizing weight variance and proportional scaling for information architecture
- Visual density optimization balancing information availability with cognitive load management
- Motion choreography implementing physics-based transitions for spatial continuity
- Accessibility-driven contrast ratios paired with intuitive navigation patterns ensuring universal usability
- Feedback responsiveness via state transitions communicating system status with minimal latency
- Content-first layouts prioritizing user objectives over decorative elements for task efficiency

## Design Principles

1. **User-First**: Every design decision prioritizes the user's core tasks and goals
2. **Simplicity**: Minimize cognitive load with clean, uncluttered interfaces
3. **Intuitive**: Follow platform conventions and established UX patterns
4. **Accessible**: Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards and support diverse user needs
5. **Responsive**: Consistent experience across all device sizes
6. **Secure**: Design supports the privacy-first architecture with local storage
