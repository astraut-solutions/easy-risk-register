# Accessibility Compliance Audit

Target: **WCAG 2.1 AA**.

## Scope

- Core flows: create/edit/delete risks, filter/sort, matrix interaction, CSV import/export
- Primary pages/views: dashboard, list/table, matrix, modal forms

## Audit Checklist (High Level)

- Perceivable: contrast, text alternatives, reflow at small screens
- Operable: keyboard access, focus management, timing/motion preferences
- Understandable: clear labels, errors, consistent navigation
- Robust: valid semantics, ARIA used only when necessary

## Evidence

Record evidence here (tool outputs, screenshots, notes) when an audit is performed.
